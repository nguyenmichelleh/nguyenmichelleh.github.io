            <p>Hello!  Thank you so much for visiting.</p>
        <br> </br>
 			<p>This business is a product of my passion for creating cakes and cupcakes that capture the invaluable quality of home-baked goods.  To me, a cake is the opportunity to bring someone's story, vision, or celebration to life through art and flavor.</p>
			<p>The art of baking was instilled in me as a child and has always carried a sense of nostalgia and comfort.  I grew up in a home where there was always a cake on the counter.  My mother would bake when she was happy, when she was sad, when it was a hot summer day and she had 30 minutes before she needed to leave the house.</p>
			<p>I have been baking and decorating customized cakes and cupcakes for 10 years, continually applying modern techniques and growing as a baker with each customer I serve.  Each component of my cakes are made from scratch, with every bit of detail and care going into them.</p>
			<p>Cake is an exciting experience, from designing it to taking the first bite, which is something I want each of my customers to feel.  My goal is to match your vision with a delicious work of art.</p>
        <br> </br>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
            <p>Lilli Flood</p>
