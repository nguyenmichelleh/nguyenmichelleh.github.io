		<h2>Cakes</h2>
		    <p>Each cake is custom made and designed. Submit any photos of other creations that you would like your cake to
			resemble, browse the gallery, or visit Instagram to select a design you would like to have recreated, or simply describe a
			look you have in mind! Choose from the flavors list or let me know if there is another flavor combination you
			desire for your order. Please note that pricing includes labor and all supplies.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Pricing</h2>

		<h2>Wedding Cakes</h2>
		    <p>Wedding cakes are custom and it is challenging to provide a base price. Simple cakes frosted with buttercream
			begin at <strong>$5.00</strong> per serving. Cakes frosted with buttercream and covered in fondant begin at <strong>$7.00</strong>
			per serving. Wedding cakes
			drastically vary in price depending on the decorations, design, flavor, and fillings chosen. When inquiring about a
			wedding cake, please provide as much detail as possible!</p>
		<br>
		<hr />
		<br>
		<h2>Geode Cakes</h2>
		    <p>Geode cakes are very popular! These cakes are decorated with rock candy and painted with coloring and gold luster
			dust to resemble the inside of an actual geode. To create depth and dimension, a chunk of cake is removed before it
			is decorated, resulting in fewer servings which you will notice below. Cakes can be made in any color and are
			constructed like a basic cake with 4 layers of cake and 3 layers of filling.</p>
		<br>
		    <p><strong>5" round (serves up to 8)</strong> $70</p>
		    <p><strong>6" round (serves up to 12)</strong> $85</p>
		    <p><strong>7" round (serves up to 18)</strong> $100</p>
