		<h2>Geode Cakes</h2>
		    <p>Geode cakes are very popular! These cakes are decorated with rock cady and painted with coloring and gold luster
			dust to resemble the inside of an actual geode. To create depth and dimension, a chunk of cake is removed before it
			is decorated, resulting in fewer servings which you will notice below. Cakes can be made in any color and are
			constructed like a basic cake with 4 layers of cake and 3 layers of filling.</p>
