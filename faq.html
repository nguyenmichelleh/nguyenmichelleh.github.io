			orders, however bigger and more detail-oriented orders may require <strong>4 weeks notice</strong>. For weddings,

			time of pick-up or delivery. I accept payment via Venmo, PayPal, or Facebook Pay. I also accept cash and check
			payments.</p>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">What if I don't know what size cake to order?</button>
			<div class="content">
		    <p>I have listed estimated servings within the pricing menu under the "CAKES" tab. If you are still unsure after
			viewing this list, I am more than happy to discuss the best option for you over the phone or via e-mail.</p>
			</div>

		    <button class="collapsible">What if I want a cake flavor that isn't listed?</button>
			<div class="content">
			<p>I am more than happy to make you a flavor of cake that has not been listed on my website! Please note the type of
			cake you would like upon ordering.</p>
			</div>

		    <button class="collapsible">What are your delivery guidelines?</button>
		    <div class="content">
			<p>I will deliver to most locations within 40 miles of my home. If you would like delivery, please specify the
			location when ordering and I will contact you to confirm whether or not your product can be delivered.</p>
			</div>

		    <button class="collapsible">How do I care for my cake and/or cupcakes?</button>
		    <div class="content">
			<p>Cupcakes: Most cupcakes can be stored at room temperature for 2-3 days. If the box is wrapped in plastic,
			preventing air from drying out the cupcakes, they will be fresh for 5 days. If your cupcakes contain an ingredient
			that needs to be refrigerated, I will provide instructions for care upon delivery or pick up.</p>
		    <p>Cakes: Always store cakes in the refrigerator. They will stay fresh for 5 days. Remove cakes 1-2 hours before
			serving. On hot summer days, cakes may only need 20-30 minutes to come to room temperature. However, if you like
			your cake cold, take it out of the fridge right before serving!</p>
		    <p><strong>DO NOT</strong> put cakes or cupcakes in direct sunlight! The buttercream will melt and you will not be
			happy.</p>
			</div>

		    <button class="collapsible">If I am picking up my order, how do I transport it?</button>
		    <div class="content">
			<p>Make sure cupcake boxes and cakes are placed on a flat surface. Placing your order on car seats or in passenger
			laps runs the risk of the masterpiece tipping over or sliding during transport. Make sure to keep your car cool!
			Cupcakes and cakes are frosted with buttercream and topped with fondant (if requested) and both elements need a cool
			environment to hold their shape. <strong>DO NOT</strong> stack boxes as they can slide or crush one another. When driving, be gentle!
			Sharp turns and sudden stops are not very friendly to cakes or cupcakes. Move any item in your car that may slide
			into your order.</p>
		    <p>I will provide a sheet upon pick-up that has this same information on it, so don't worry if you forget! I will
			also help you load your order into your car to ensure that it is in a safe place. I am not responsible for damage to
			an order that has been picked up by a customer.</p>
